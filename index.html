  <li><span class="innerbox"><h3>Joan Holcomb used to be obese, but after a lot of hard work, reached a healthy weight and has maintained it for over 20 years. While she was losing weight, she spent a lot of time trying out various low-calorie recipes. Some weren't so good. Some were. She has gathered the best of these recipes in her cookbooks. (Note: your taste may not be the same as Joan's, however!)</h3></span></li>
